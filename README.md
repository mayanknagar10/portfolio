## Projects
### STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION
[Report](https://github.com/mayanknagar10/stock-market-analysis-and-prediction/blob/main/Thesis%20Report.pdf) | [Link](https://github.com/mayanknagar10/stock-market-analysis-and-prediction)

![project1](https://github.com/mayanknagar10/portfolio/assets/86146916/7f42ac59-e0a1-44e4-b30b-5073a32b8f23)

- Conducted data analysis using real-time stock market data and APIs. Utilized deep learning algorithms for precise future price forecasting.
- The proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes pre-processing of the stock market dataset, utilization of feature engineering techniques, combined with customized deep learning algorithms for stock market price trend prediction.
- We conducted comprehensive evaluations on frequently used deep learning models and conclude that our suggested solution outperforms due to the analysis part and different feature engineering that we built.
- With the detailed design and evaluation of prediction, trends, and data pre-processing methods, this work contributes both in the financial and technical domains.

### CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

- The Earthquake Database classifies significant earthquake as those that meet some criteria.
- Criterias are Caused Death, Moderate Damage, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Intensity X or greater, or those that generated a Tsunami.
- This visual explores the significant earthquakes since 1921 and provides information about Data and Time of Occurance, Magnitude, Cost of Damage done, Number of Deaths, and more.
